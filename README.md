# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to uncover trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across different regions. It uses Python and pandas for data manipulation, with visualizations powered by seaborn and matplotlib.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes daily records for various countries and regions with the following columns:

Date: Date of the record
State: Sub-region or state (may contain missing values)
Region: Country or region name
Confirmed: Number of confirmed cases
Deaths: Number of deaths
Recovered: Number of recoveries

# Key Questions Explored
Which regions had the highest and lowest confirmed cases?
Which regions reported zero deaths?
What were the confirmed, death, and recovery numbers for India on April 29, 2020?
How can we clean and filter the dataset to remove low-case records?
How do confirmed and recovered cases compare across top regions?

# Technologies Used
Python 
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib

# Sample Insights
The United States had the highest number of confirmed cases on April 29, 2020.
Several regions like Cambodia, Seychelles, and Saint Lucia reported zero deaths.
India reported 33,062 confirmed cases, 1,079 deaths, and 8,437 recoveries on that date.
Null values were present in the State column and visualized using a heatmap.
